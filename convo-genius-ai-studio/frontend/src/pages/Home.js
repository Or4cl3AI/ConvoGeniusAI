Here is the code for the file convo-genius-ai-studio/frontend/src/pages/Home.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to ConvoGenius AI Studio</h1>
      <p>Where conversations, code, and dreams come to life!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

This code defines a functional component called `Home` that renders a heading and a paragraph. It is a simple starting point for the home page of the ConvoGenius AI Studio application.
