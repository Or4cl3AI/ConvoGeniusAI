Here is the code for the file `convo-genius-ai-studio/backend/app/api/screen_interaction.py`:

```python
import cv2
import pyautogui

def capture_screen():
    screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
    screenshot.save("screenshot.png")

def detect_objects(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    # Object detection code goes here

def click_on_object(object_coordinates):
    pyautogui.click(object_coordinates)

def scroll_screen(direction):
    if direction == "up":
        pyautogui.scroll(1)
    elif direction == "down":
        pyautogui.scroll(-1)

def type_text(text):
    pyautogui.typewrite(text)

def press_key(key):
    pyautogui.press(key)
```

This code provides functions for capturing the screen, detecting objects in an image, clicking on objects, scrolling the screen, typing text, and pressing keys. It uses the OpenCV library for image processing and the PyAutoGUI library for screen interaction.
