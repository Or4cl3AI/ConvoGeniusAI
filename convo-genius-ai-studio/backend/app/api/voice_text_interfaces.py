This code defines two functions: `recognize_speech()` and `text_to_speech()`. The `recognize_speech()` function uses the SpeechRecognition library to listen for audio input from the user's microphone and convert it to text using Google's speech recognition service. The recognized speech is then returned as a string.

The `text_to_speech()` function uses the gTTS library to convert text to speech. It takes a string as input and returns the audio data as bytes.
