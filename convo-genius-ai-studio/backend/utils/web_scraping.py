Sure! Here's the code for the file `convo-genius-ai-studio/backend/utils/web_scraping.py`:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_website(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        # Perform web scraping operations here
        # ...
    else:
        print("Failed to scrape website:", response.status_code)

```

This code imports the necessary libraries `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping. It defines a function `scrape_website` that takes a URL as input and performs web scraping operations using the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content and the `BeautifulSoup` library to parse the HTML and extract the desired data.

Please note that this is just a basic template for web scraping and you would need to customize it based on your specific requirements and the structure of the website you want to scrape.
